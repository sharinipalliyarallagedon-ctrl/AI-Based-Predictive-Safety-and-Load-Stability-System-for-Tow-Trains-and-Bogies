# AI-Based-Predictive-Safety-and-Load-Stability-System-for-Tow-Trains-and-Bogies
This project develops a MATLAB-based predictive safety system for tow trains and bogies. By combining mechanical modelling with machine learning, the system predicts instability events such as skidding, snaking, and tipping under varying load, slope, and friction conditions.
